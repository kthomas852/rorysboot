# Project 1 - todo app

### Objective
In this app it will be possible to post new todo items.  The user should be able to use an input field to dynamically post new todo's to the page underneath the input field and button.  

This site should have full styling for all the components and should be visually pleasing as a whole.  Some Styling has been put in place for you.  If you would like to make changes to it so it fits better with your overall idea, that is fine.

These todo items should also be clickable. When a todo is clicked the styling will change in a manner that will indicate to the user that the item has been completed.

Feel free to add as many functions as you need to make the application work.

**ExtraPoints:** Make it so that the styling will toggle back and forth from completed to not completed.
